Hi, I’m **Aidynbek Mussa**, a data analyst and economist passionate about solving complex problems with data. I bring a unique blend of quantitative skills, economic insight, and systems thinking to turn raw information into meaningful impact.

I hold a **Master’s in Management and Systems (Enterprise Risk concentration)** from NYU and a **Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics** from Nazarbayev University. My career began at the **National Bank of Kazakhstan**, where I worked on macroeconomic forecasting, policy modeling, and IMF technical projects.

Now based in New York, I focus on combining analytics, engineering, and storytelling to build smart solutions. My interests span:
- **Data science & machine learning**
- **Graph databases (Neo4j, GTD terrorism analysis)**
- **ETL pipeline engineering**
- **AI in education & public policy**

I’ve built real-world projects ranging from NYC crime clustering to gas price dashboards for small businesses. I’m currently exploring how GenAI and automation can reskill workforces and streamline public services.

Outside of work, I co-develop **GetEnglish**, an AI-powered language learning assistant on Telegram.
